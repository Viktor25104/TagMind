# TagMind — AI Knowledge Base

Authoritative, code-synced documentation for AI agents and humans. Treat this directory as the single source of truth. If facts ever diverge from code/configs, update these files.

Recommended reading order for a new AI session:
1. PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md — what TagMind is and the scope of the repo
2. CURRENT_STATE.md — what is implemented today
3. ARCHITECTURE.md — how the system is shaped
4. SERVICES.md — per-service details
5. CONTRACTS.md — OpenAPI locations and caveats
6. RUNBOOK.md — how to run/verify locally
7. DECISIONS.md and COMMIT_HISTORY.md — why things are the way they are and how we got here
